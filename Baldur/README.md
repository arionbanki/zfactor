# Guess the card!

Dealer deals two cards, one face up and the other facedown from
a deck of 26 cards. It's the goal for the player to correctly 
guess if the facedown card is higher or lower than the faceup one.

A single gamle is played until the 26 card is emptied giving a 
total of 13 points to go around. In the case of equal cards the
dealer receives a point!

Good luck!
